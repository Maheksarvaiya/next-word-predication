 Next Word Prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) 
 I trained the model on the Hamlet dataset, where the goal was to predict the next word based on previous words.
🧠 This project helped me understand:
-How text tokenization works
-How sequences are created for language modeling
-How LSTM layers learn patterns from text
-How training parameters like epochs, batch size, and validation data affect the model
-How to use Early Stopping to avoid overfitting
My model currently achieves around 40% accuracy, and I’m continuously learning and improving it.
